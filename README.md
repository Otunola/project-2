7. Since NginX works well now we install a server to handle the database for the web server. we use mysql and will install with the command
 : sudo apt install mysql-server
8. after installation is finished, log in to the MySQL console by typing: sudo mysql

9.  Run a security script that comes pre-installed with MySQL. This  will remove some insecure default settings and put a password unto the database:
: ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'PassWord.1';
10. the password of the database is now set to PassWord.1

11.the database can now be accessed with the command : sudo mysql -p
 and the password will be required to access it because of the -p
 12. Your MySQL server is now installed and secured. Next, we will install PHP, the final component in the LEMP stack.
